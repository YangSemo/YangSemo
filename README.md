🌟 Hello! I'm SeMo Yang, a passionate IT professional specializing in cutting-edge cloud solutions and open-source distribution operations. As a graduate student at Gachon University, I've honed my skills in federated learning and collaborated with top-tier global enterprises to drive innovative projects.

💡 My journey includes developing adaptive federated learning technologies in dynamic device environments, where I've leveraged various open-source federated learning frameworks for real-world applications. My work in cloud-based lifecycle management for federated learning has been crucial in bringing these advanced technologies into practical use.

🔍 Additionally, I've been deeply involved in projects like demand shifting services based on electric energy usage prediction models and early risk detection algorithms using AI-based behavior recognition. These projects have not only sharpened my technical skills but also allowed me to contribute significantly to energy management and healthcare sectors.

🌏 A highlight of my career has been collaborating with global companies like Flower Labs. Our partnership focused on designing and refining the FedOps platform - a testament to my commitment to global standards and practices in federated learning lifecycle management.

🚀 I'm enthusiastic about exploring new challenges in cloud environments, particularly Kubernetes and Docker, and advancing federated learning through open-source platforms and operational strategies. Let's connect and discuss how we can drive innovation together!
